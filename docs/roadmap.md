# Roadmap

Early ideas:

- Error checking is still a pain point. deck.gl because of language differences lacks errors that would obviously be thrown in python (more often than I'd like, I'll specify a layer attribute like color from a field that's not in my data set)
- Categorical legends, time scrubbers, and "explanation boxes" like on the top right corner of this example: https://deck.gl/#/examples/core-layers/hexagon-layer
- integration with something like keplerâ€“specify your map configuration/viewport settings in kepler and then copy/paste them into pydeck, and/or use pydeck to configure kepler like arcpy configures arcgis
