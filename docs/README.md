# pydeck

Welcome to pydeck

## TODO 

pydeck docs are curretly written in rst format, not markdown to support sphinx doc generation.

Ideally we can find a way to avoid maintaining two copies of the documentation.

There is a gatsby-plugin-rst at https://github.com/rst-js/rst-js#readme, though the documentation seems poor it should be worth an investigation.
